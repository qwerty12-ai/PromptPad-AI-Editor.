# 🚀 PromptPad — The Full-Stack Prompt Engineering Workspace

**PromptPad** is a full-stack **Next.js** application built from scratch — a complete workspace for **prompt engineers**, **AI creators**, and **developers** who want to write, test, and analyze prompts in one place.

This project was developed independently from the ground up — *idea → execution → UI/UX → database + authentication → debugging → final prototype*.

---

## ✨ Overview

PromptPad is designed to feel like a *VS Code–style editor* for AI prompt workflows.  
It lets you:

- 🧾 Write and save prompts (with version-like tracking)  
- ✏ Edit and update prompts directly in the editor  
- ⚖ Compare multiple prompts side-by-side  
- 📊 Analyze latency per prompt  
- 🤖 Generate AI outputs directly using the *open-source [Puter.js](https://puter.com)* library  

> Built for prompt engineers who actually build.

## 🔥 Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| *AI Output Generation* | Integrated with Puter.js to generate outputs without external API dependencies. |
| *Prompt Analytics* | Displays prompt performance (currently reads 0 ms latency due to site design). |
| *GitHub Authentication* | Uses NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth — simple, secure, dev-centric. |
| *Responsive Dashboard* | Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern UI. |
| *MongoDB + Mongoose* | Persistent storage for all prompts and generated outputs. |
| *Compare View* | View and analyze prompts side by side. |
| *Production-Ready Architecture* | Modular code, RESTful API routes, and full Next.js app-router setup. |

## 🔒 Why Only GitHub Auth?

PromptPad is designed for *developers and prompt engineers* — people who already live on GitHub.  
It’s not meant for casual users or generic accounts; it’s a focused workspace for builders.

That’s why the only sign-in method right now is *GitHub OAuth*.  
> Other providers (Google, etc.) may be added later — but keeping the workspace focused felt right for this stage.

## 🧰 Future Improvements

🔁 Multi-model support (GPT-5 Nano, Llama, Mistral, etc.)  
🌐 Multi-auth providers (Google OAuth + Email Magic Link)  
📈 Real-time analytics for latency & output metrics  
🧱 Collaborative prompt editing

## 💬 About

PromptPad started as an experiment — a personal challenge to build something uniquely mine rather than another tutorial clone.  
Now it stands as a fully functional AI prompt editor ready for future scalability.

> “I made a VS Code-like workspace for prompt engineers — not a clone, not a course assignment, but an idea I built end-to-end.”
